# ROBLOX's default gravity system, rewritten
## Introduction

This originally started as a project developed by myself for a smaller development group that required "slope physics" that replicate those seen in many of the popular "Sonic The Hedgehog" titles,
as well as the gravity physics seen inside of Super Mario Galaxy.

I took on the challenge myself, using various methods and decided to provide a solution to the public, that they can open source and use. 
Anyone who uses this gravity controller/system must credit me, Krish "worhas".

**I will be updating this system every now and then, fixing bugs and making things more efficient.**
