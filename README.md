# ROBLOX's default gravity system, rewritten
## Theory

This originally started as a project developed by myself for a smaller development group that required "slope physics" that replicate those seen in many of the popular "Sonic The Hedgehog" titles,
as well as the gravity physics seen inside of Super Mario Galaxy.
*Sonic Physics Example*

I took on the challenge myself, using various methods and decided to provide a solution to the public, that they can open source and use. 
Anyone who uses this gravity controller/system must credit me, Krish "worhas".

**I will be updating this system every now and then, fixing bugs and making things more efficient.**


## Physics explanation + Extra theory

*This will go over pretty much everything that makes the system actually tick, so be ready*

### Vectors, Velocities and Gravity


### Rays


### Detection (falls under rays)



## Documentation

*TBD*
